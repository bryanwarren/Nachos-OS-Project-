1. MIPS instruction: lw. System calls: open, exec, create
2. testvmfork.c can run smoothly because it never asks for memory. Other tests like testvm.c and testvmexec.c have buffers, while testvmfork.c does not. So, there is no page fault/page replacement even though the memory used by the test code exceeds the available memory size.
3. All of the assignment is completed. For the first part of the swapPageIn function, we either look for an open space to place the page or we look for a page where the use bit is set (to replace it). If there is a free space for a page, we load the new page info into the space. If we find a space that is occupied, we overwrite the space with the new page. This involves setting the dirty bit to true. To find the next victim, we used the formula (nextVictim + 1) % NumPhysPages to circle back to the beginning if we reach the last page.
